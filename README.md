# Memex UI

An Angular application that implements a UI for submitting and retrieving entries from a knowledge base, named for the [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) described in a 1945 Atlantic article.

The purpose of the application is to store notes with tags so that those notes may be later referenced across months and years.

The application is not currently in use. I have shifted to use of a purchased product.

The application interacts with [memex-service](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/memex-service) as its backend.

Scripts for hosting the application on AWS are provided by [k8s-standalone](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/k8s-standalone).

### Using the UI locally
To run the Angular application, see the [docker/README.md](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/memex-ui/blob/master/docker/README.md).
