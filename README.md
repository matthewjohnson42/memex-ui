# Memex UI

An Angular application that implements a UI for submitting and retrieving entries from a knowledge base, named for the [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) described in a 1945 Atlantic article.

The purpose of the application was to store notes with tags so that those notes could later be referenced across months and years.

### The application is not currently in use, and this repository is archived.

The application interacts with [memex-service](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/memex-service) as its backend.

The build process for the application is broken given changes to dependencies.
