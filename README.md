# Personal Memex UI

An Angular application that implements a UI for submitting and retrieving entries from a personal knowledge base, named for the [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) described in a 1945 Atlantic article.

The application is planned to be hosted on AWS, and is planned to interact with [personal-memex-service](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/personal-memex-service) as its backend.

The purpose of the application is to store notes with tags so that those notes may be later referenced across months and years.

### Using the app locally
To run the Angular application, see the [docker/README.md](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/personal-memex-ui/blob/master/docker/README.md).
