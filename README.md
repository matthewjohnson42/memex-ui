# Memex UI

An Angular application that implements a UI for submitting and retrieving entries from a knowledge base, named for the [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) described in a 1945 Atlantic article.

The purpose of the application was to store notes with tags so that those notes may be later referenced across months and years.

**The application is not currently in use, and this repository archived.**

The application interacts with [memex-service](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/memex-service) as its backend.

Scripts for hosting the application on AWS are provided by [k8s-standalone](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/k8s-standalone).

To run the Angular application, see the [docker/README.md](https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/memex-ui/blob/master/docker/README.md).
